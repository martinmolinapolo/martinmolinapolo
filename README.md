- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @martinmolinapolo
I'm  a Computer Science major in Ecuador, with a background in Data Science. Before my career change, I learned a little about machine learning models, natural language processing, the R language and a lot about statistics and math. I also collaborated in two major projects: the first one is a project started by FundaciÃ³n Charles Darwin, who wanted to know what is the current state of the Galapagos Islands' ecosystem; the other one was a sociological research project that analyzed what ecuadorian people thought about people from different ecuadorian regions. However, right now I'm focused on more technical areas like compilers, operating systems and computer networks. The project I'm working on currently is a simple shell emulation, but I've done a memory allocator and simple command-line tools for Linux.

Finally, my passions lie in between art and computer science, and I would love to mix these two areas someday. Also, I really like Linux and my daily driver is Arch.
