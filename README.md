- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @martinmolinapolo
I'm about to enter my second year of university and I am majoring in Data Science. My main interests revolve around mathematics, statistics and physics but I spend a lot of
time learning new technologies. Right now I am learning web development and opened this github account to host my webpage. I also enjoy competitive programming, being Codeforces my main website to practice.
Regarding real life projects, I am working in an important data analysis that has to do with the Galapos Islands's ecosystem.
- If my skills improve quickly, I would love to collaborate in a machine learning/artificial intelligence project. In the future I want to expand my knowledge in robotics/mechanical engineering so I can build things
(my knowledge in this area is very limited). 

You can reach me through my email: martinmolinapolo@hotmail.com
Fun fact: I cannot do chemistry.
